### Motivation


### Changes from original

* Timer is no longer restricted to 20 Minutes maximum, has been extended to 40
  Minutes.

* Removed the Google Analytics and related scripts.

* The files have been neatly organized into the proper folders.

## Get it

The Countdown Timer is free to use, and can be accessed through any Web browser.
Using Chrome’s Presentation Mode allows you to focus only on the timer.  If you
want to use the Timer like an app on
your mobile device, tap on the share icon (iOS) or menu button (Android)
 and select “Add to Home Screen.”

## Use it

To start the Timer, select the duration of your talk (choose any length from 2
to 18 minutes). Next hit "Start now" to begin the countdown immediately, or
"Start in 10 seconds" to give yourself time to get ready.

For a less distracting countdown, the Timer initially displays minutes only —
for example, a 14-minute talk will flash “14” to start, then display “13” for
the next 60 seconds, then “12,” and so on.  The dots along the bottom show your
progress through each minute (each dot represents six seconds).

The Timer will switch to a second-by-second countdown at 90 seconds. If you go
over your chosen time, the Timer screen will turn red, flash "OVER TIME," and
begin counting up.

To pause the Timer, use the button in the lower right corner; if you're on a
laptop or desktop machine, move your mouse to make the pause button appear.

If you spot a bug or just need help, feel free to raise a ticket and we shall
respond as fast as possible.
